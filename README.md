This is a free application that allows you to track score and time of a basketball game.<br>
It's meant to be simple, because it was created to be used on training games, where fouls are not counted.<br>
The app is currently on Ukrainian. You are free to make a localization if you wish. Or I can make it for you, for a small donation.<br>
The app is ad free.<br>
