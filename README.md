This is a free application that allows you to track score, time and fouls of a basketball game.<br>
It's meant to be simple, because it was created to be used on training games.<br>
The app is currently Ukrainian only. You are free to make a localization if you wish. Or I can make it for you for a small donation.<br>
The app is ad free.<br>
