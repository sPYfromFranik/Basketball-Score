This is a free application that allows you to track score and time of a basketball game.
It's meant to be simple, because it was created to be used on training games, where fouls are not counted.
The app is currently on Ukrainian. You are free to make a localization if you wish. Or I can make it for you, for a small donation.
The app is ad free.
